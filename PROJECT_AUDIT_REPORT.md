# Project Audit Report – Video Funnel Builder

## Overview
This report consolidates the technical debt, security gaps, performance concerns, and production‑readiness tasks identified across the **frontend**, **backend**, and **dev‑ops** layers of the Video Funnel Builder project.

---

## 1. Front‑end (React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS)

### 1.1 Technical Debt
| Area | Issue | Impact | Recommended Action |
|------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| State Management | `answers` prop still referenced in legacy components (e.g., old `QuizContainer`). | Potential TypeScript errors, stale data. | Remove all legacy `answers` usages; rely solely on Zustand store. |
| Persistence | Submissions stored only in `localStorage` via Zustand. | Data loss on device change, no server‑side backup. | Implement `/api/submissions` endpoints and sync store actions (`addSubmission`, `updateSubmission`). |
| Loading UI | `AnswerAnalysis` lacks spinner during AI request. | Poor UX, users think app is frozen. | Add `isAnalyzing` flag in store; show `LoadingSpinner` in component. |
| Error Reporting | AI call errors are swallowed in `AnswerCard`. | Users unaware of failures; debugging harder. | Centralize error handling, display toast notifications, log to backend. |
| Routing | Dashboard navigation uses conditional rendering, no deep linking. | Inability to bookmark/share specific views. | Integrate `react-router-dom` with routes `/dashboard` and `/submission/:id`. |
| Security of Share Links | Config is base64‑encoded without integrity check. | Tampering possible, malicious funnel definitions. | Sign payload server‑side (HMAC) and verify on load. |
| Accessibility | Not all interactive elements have ARIA labels/focus styles. | Fails WCAG compliance. | Run axe audit, add missing ARIA attributes, ensure keyboard navigation. |
| Responsive Design | Media viewers overflow on small screens. | Breaks mobile experience. | Add responsive Tailwind utilities, test on breakpoints. |
| Unused Imports / Dead Code | Several files import deprecated `answers` or icons. | Increases bundle size, lint warnings. | Run `tsc --noEmit` and ESLint `--fix` to clean imports. |
| Performance | `ResultsDashboard` renders all submissions at once. | Slow rendering for large datasets. | Implement pagination or virtual scrolling (e.g., `react-window`). |

### 1.2 Production‑Readiness Checklist
- ✅ **Build passes** with Vite (`npm run build`).
- ✅ **Environment variables** are loaded from `.env.local` and `.env.production`.
- ✅ **CORS** configured for local dev proxy.
- ❌ **HTTPS** not enforced in dev; need TLS for production.
- ❌ **Content Security Policy** missing.
- ❌ **Rate limiting** on API endpoints not configured.
- ❌ **Static asset caching** headers not set.

## 2. Back‑end (Fastify, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Docker)

### 2.1 Technical Debt
| Area | Issue | Impact | Recommended Action |
|------|-------|--------|--------------------|
| JWT Security | Tokens stored in `localStorage`; no httpOnly flag. | XSS risk, token theft. | Move refresh token to httpOnly secure cookie; encrypt access token in storage. |
| Validation | Validation schemas centralized but some routes still use ad‑hoc checks. | Inconsistent error messages, potential injection. | Ensure all routes use shared `zod` schemas. |
| Error Handling | Generic 500 responses without error codes. | Hard to debug client‑side. | Implement structured error format `{code, message, details}`. |
| Database Migrations | Prisma migrations applied manually. | Risk of drift between environments. | Add migration scripts to Docker entrypoint, run `prisma migrate deploy` on startup. |
| Logging | Minimal request logging; no correlation IDs. | Difficult to trace issues in production. | Integrate `pino` with request IDs, output to stdout for container logs. |
| Health Checks | `/health` endpoint exists but does not check DB connectivity. | False‑positive health status. | Extend health check to query DB connection. |
| Secrets Management | `.env.local` contains DB credentials; not encrypted. | Secrets leakage risk. | Use Docker secrets or environment variables injected by orchestration platform. |
| Rate Limiting | No rate limiting on auth or funnel endpoints. | Brute‑force attacks possible. | Add Fastify rate‑limit plugin with per‑IP limits. |
| Testing | No unit/integration tests for API routes. | Low confidence in stability. | Add Jest + supertest suite covering auth, funnel CRUD, submissions. |
| CI/CD | No GitHub Actions pipeline. | Manual deployments, inconsistent builds. | Create workflow to lint, test, build Docker image, push to registry. |

### 2.2 Production‑Readiness Checklist
- ✅ **Dockerfiles** for dev and prod exist.
- ✅ **Docker‑compose** spins up backend + PostgreSQL.
- ❌ **TLS termination** not configured (needs reverse proxy like Nginx/Traefik).
- ❌ **Graceful shutdown** handling missing.
- ❌ **Resource limits** (CPU/memory) not set in compose.
- ❌ **Backup strategy** for PostgreSQL not defined.

## 3. Dev‑Ops / Infrastructure

| Item | Current State | Gap | Action |
|------|---------------|-----|--------|
| Container Orchestration | Docker‑compose locally. | No production orchestration (K8s, Swarm). | Define Helm chart or Docker‑stack for production. |
| Monitoring | None. | No visibility into runtime errors or performance. | Add Prometheus + Grafana; expose Fastify metrics via `fastify-metrics`. |
| Logging Aggregation | Container stdout only. | Hard to search logs across instances. | Ship logs to Loki or CloudWatch. |
| CI/CD | None. | Manual builds. | Implement GitHub Actions pipeline (lint, test, build, push). |
| Secrets Management | `.env` files. | Secrets in repo risk. | Use GitHub Secrets + Docker secret injection. |
| Automated Deployments | Manual `docker compose up`. | No zero‑downtime deploys. | Use rolling updates with Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. |
| Documentation | README covers setup; audit file exists. | Missing API docs, architecture diagram. | Generate OpenAPI spec from Fastify routes; add architecture diagram to docs. |

## 4. Prioritized Action Plan (Next 4 Weeks)
| Sprint | Goal | Tasks |
|--------|------|-------|
| **Week 1** | Stabilize persistence & routing | • Implement `/api/submissions` (POST, GET, PATCH).<br>• Sync Zustand actions to backend.<br>• Add `react-router-dom` with `/dashboard` and `/submission/:id`. |
| **Week 2** | Security hardening | • Move refresh token to httpOnly secure cookie.<br>• Sign share‑link payload (HMAC) and verify on load.<br>• Add Fastify rate‑limit plugin.<br>• Enforce HTTPS via reverse proxy (NGINX). |
| **Week 3** | Observability & testing | • Integrate `pino` logging with request IDs.<br>• Add health check DB connectivity.<br>• Write Jest + supertest suite for backend routes.<br>• Add frontend unit tests for store and dashboard components. |
| **Week 4** | CI/CD & performance | • Create GitHub Actions workflow (lint, test, build Docker image).<br>• Implement pagination/virtual scroll in `ResultsDashboard`.
• Optimize bundle (tree‑shake unused icons, enable code‑splitting). |

## 5. Quick Wins (Can be done immediately)
- Run ESLint `--fix` to remove dead imports.
- Add `LoadingSpinner` to `AnswerAnalysis` while awaiting AI response.
- Create a simple toast component for global error messages.
- Update `README.md` with instructions for running the new API endpoints.
- Document environment variables in a `ENVIRONMENT.md` file.
